Machine Learning/DL Project Template
Welcome to this Machine Learning/Deep Learning project template! This repository is designed to help you kickstart your ML/DL projects by providing a clean and organized folder structure.

We have trained a machine learning model using the provided student data to predict a student's math score based on various attributes. The model is saved in the /artifacts/model.pkl

Getting Started
1. To get started with this project, follow these steps:

2. Clone or Download the Repository: You can either fork this repository or download it directly to your local machine.

3. Set up the Python Environment: Navigate to the project directory and create a Python environment. You can do this using a virtual environment or your preferred method.

conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
conda activate C:\Deependra\generic-ML-project\venv  #Activate on your environmemnt location
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Deependra\generic-ML-project       #Set PYTHONPATH

4. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Project: To run the example prediction project, execute the following command:
python app.py

6. Access the Web Application: Once the project is running, you can access the web application by opening your browser and going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

7. Make Predictions: To make predictions based on the provided student data, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata. Fill out the form, and the application will provide you with the predicted value.


Feel free to customize and build upon this template for your specific ML/DL project needs. Happy coding!
